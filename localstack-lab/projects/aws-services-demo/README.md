# AWS Services Demo for LocalStack

Complete Java application for testing AWS services (DynamoDB, SQS, S3) with LocalStack.

## 📋 Project Overview

This is a standalone Java application that demonstrates how to interact with AWS services using LocalStack for local development and testing.

**Author**: GitHub Copilot AI  
**Created**: 2026-01-02  
**Purpose**: LocalStack AWS services testing and demonstration

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **DynamoDB Testing** - Table creation, item CRUD operations
- ✅ **SQS Testing** - Queue creation, message send/receive/delete
- ✅ **S3 Testing** - Bucket creation, file upload/download
- ✅ **Automatic Logging** - Test results saved to log file
- ✅ **Detailed Comments** - Comprehensive JavaDoc and inline comments
- ✅ **Complete Documentation** - 7 markdown documentation files

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher
- Docker Desktop
- LocalStack running on port 4566

### Run Tests

```bash
# Start LocalStack
docker start localstack

# Run the demo
cd localstack-lab/projects/aws-services-demo
mvn clean compile exec:java
```

### View Results

```bash
# View log file
cat aws-services-test-result.log

# Or on Windows
notepad aws-services-test-result.log
```

## 📊 Test Results

All tests **PASSED** ✓

## 🎯 What Does It Test?

### DynamoDB
- Create table with hash key
- Insert item with attributes
- Query item by primary key
- List all tables

### SQS
- Create standard queue
- Send message to queue
- Receive message from queue
- Delete processed message
- List all queues

### S3
- Create bucket
- Upload file (from memory string)
- Download file
- List all buckets

## 💡 Key Features

### Single File Architecture
All code in **one Java class** for simplicity and easy understanding.

### Automatic Log Generation
Test results are automatically saved to `aws-services-test-result.log`:
- Timestamp of execution
- Detailed step-by-step output
- Success/failure summary
- Error stack traces (if any)

### Detailed Comments
Every method and important code block has comprehensive comments explaining:
- What it does
- How it works
- Why it's designed that way

## 🔍 How to Read the Code

The main class `AwsServicesDemo.java` contains:

1. **Configuration** - LocalStack endpoint and region
2. **Client Factories** - Methods to create AWS clients
3. **Test Methods** - One method per service
4. **Main Method** - Orchestrates all tests

```java
main()
  ├─> testDynamoDB()
  ├─> testSQS()
  └─> testS3()
```

## 📝 Sample Output

```
[1] Testing DynamoDB...
  - Creating DynamoDB table: TestTable
  ✓ Table created successfully
  - Putting item into table
  ✓ Item inserted successfully
  - Getting item from table
  ✓ Item retrieved: {id=..., name=...}
  ✓ Tables: [TestTable]
[1] DynamoDB Test: ✓ SUCCESS

[2] Testing SQS...
  - Creating SQS queue: test-queue
  ✓ Queue created: http://sqs...
  ✓ Message sent, ID: ...
  ✓ Message received: Hello LocalStack!
  ✓ Message deleted
[2] SQS Test: ✓ SUCCESS

[3] Testing S3...
  - Creating S3 bucket: test-bucket-demo
  ✓ Bucket created successfully
  ✓ File uploaded successfully
  ✓ File downloaded: Hello from LocalStack S3!
[3] S3 Test: ✓ SUCCESS
```

## 🛠️ Configuration

### LocalStack Endpoint
```java
private static final String LOCALSTACK_ENDPOINT = "http://localhost:4566";
```

### AWS Region
```java
private static final Region REGION = Region.US_EAST_1;
```

### Credentials
Uses dummy credentials (`test/test`) - LocalStack doesn't validate them.
